- **Hit Rate Analysis**: Percentage of requests that match mocks vs. 404s
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance data updates

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. Analytics Middleware (`server/middleware/analytics.js`)
- Tracks all incoming requests automatically
- Captures timing, mock matching, and response data
- Maintains in-memory analytics store with configurable limits
- Provides data aggregation and filtering capabilities

#### 2. Analytics Routes (`server/routes/analyticsRoutes.js`)
- RESTful API endpoints for analytics data
- Supports filtering, pagination, and export functionality
- Provides dashboard, history, and performance data

#### 3. Integration Points
- Added to main server (`server/index.js`)
- Middleware integration for automatic tracking
- Header injection for mock identification

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Tabbed Interface
- **Mock Management**: Existing mock creation and management
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time overview with charts and metrics
- **Request History**: Detailed request log with filtering

#### 2. Dashboard Visualizations
- Response time distribution chart (bar chart)
- Status code distribution (progress bars)
- Top mocks list with hit counts
- Daily trends over last 7 days
- Recent requests feed

#### 3. History Management
- Advanced filtering form
- Paginated table view
- Export functionality
- Real-time updates

## üîó API Endpoints

### Analytics Endpoints
- `GET /api/analytics/summary` - Overview statistics
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` - Complete dashboard data
- `GET /api/analytics/requests` - Request history with filtering
- `GET /api/analytics/performance` - Performance metrics only
- `GET /api/analytics/export` - Export analytics data (JSON/CSV)
- `DELETE /api/analytics` - Clear all analytics data

### Query Parameters for History
- `startDate`, `endDate` - Date range filtering
- `method` - HTTP method filter
- `path` - Path contains filter
- `statusCode` - Status code filter
- `mockId` - Specific mock filter
- `search` - Free text search
- `page`, `limit` - Pagination

## üé® UI Design

### Visual Design
- Glassmorphism design consistent with existing UI
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Color-coded elements:
  - Green: Success (200s)
  - Yellow: Client errors (400s)
  - Red: Server errors (500s)
  - Blue: Information and actions

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast elements
- Responsive text sizing

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Starting the Server
```bash
npm start
# or
node server/index.js
```

### 2. Accessing the Dashboard
1. Open `http://localhost:8080/api/` in your browser
2. Use the tab navigation to switch between:
   - **Mock Management**: Create and manage mocks
   - **Analytics Dashboard**: View real-time analytics
   - **Request History**: Browse detailed request logs

### 3. Generating Analytics Data
1. Create mocks using the Mock Management tab
2. Make requests to your mock endpoints
3. View real-time analytics in the Dashboard tab
4. Use filters in the History tab to analyze specific patterns

### 4. Exporting Data
- **Dashboard**: Use "Export" button for complete analytics dump
- **History**: Use "Export CSV" for request history spreadsheet

## üìà Data Storage

### In-Memory Storage
- **Request History**: Last 10,000 requests (configurable)
- **Response Times**: Last 1,000 response times (configurable)
- **Daily Stats**: Last 30 days of aggregated data
- **Mock Hit Counts**: Persistent until server restart

### Storage Limits
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat
- Configurable limits for different data types
- Efficient data structures for fast querying

## üîÑ Real-time Updates

### Auto-refresh Capabilities
- Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Manual refresh buttons available
- Real-time updates when tab is active

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient data aggregation
- Minimal UI re-rendering
- Optimized API calls

## üîê Security Considerations

- No sensitive data stored in analytics
- User IP addresses are optionally stored
- Request bodies are not stored by default
- Export functionality requires no authentication (same as existing endpoints)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script
A test script (`test-analytics.sh`) is provided to verify the implementation:
```bash
./tests/scripts/test-analytics.sh
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the server
2. Create test mocks
3. Generate sample traffic
4. Verify analytics data appears
5. Test filtering and export functionality

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Database persistence for analytics data
- Advanced charting with libraries like Chart.js
- Alert system for performance thresholds
- Integration with external monitoring tools
- API rate limiting and quota tracking
- Geographic request analysis
- Mock performance comparison

### Scalability Considerations
- Database storage implementation
- Data archival strategies
- Performance optimization for high-traffic scenarios
- Distributed analytics collection

## üìã Dependencies

### Existing Dependencies Used
- Express.js for routing
- Existing logging and utility functions
- No additional npm packages required

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## üéâ Conclusion

The analytics dashboard implementation provides comprehensive monitoring and insights for the Dynamic Mock Server. It offers real-time visibility into mock usage patterns, performance metrics, and detailed request history, making it easier to optimize and troubleshoot mock API behavior.

The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, responsive design, and efficient data management. It integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and maintains the same modern UI design principles.
